# Memory Card Project

This project is part of The Odin Project's React course. It aims to reinforce the use of **React hooks** for state management and the integration of external APIs to fetch and display data dynamically.

## üéÆ **How the Game Works**

The Memory Card game is a simple yet fun project to test your memory! Players click on cards to score points, but clicking the same card twice resets the score. The cards shuffle each time you click, keeping you on your toes.
